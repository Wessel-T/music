          <h4 class="mt-4 alinea-1">
            Nirvana was an influential grunge band formed in 1987 in Aberdeen,
            Washington, by Kurt Cobain (singer and guitarist) and Krist
            Novoselic (bassist). The band had several drummers, but Dave Grohl,
            who joined in 1990, was the longest-serving. With their album
            "Nevermind" in the early '90s, Nirvana took the music industry by
            storm and brought grunge to a bigger audience. Their sound and
            impact are still huge to this day and age.
          </h4>

          <h4 class="mt-5 alinea-2">
            The band made three official albums, five live albums. They released
            twenty-one singles, including "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and "Come As
            You Are". After the band signed with the major label DGC Records,
            they experienced unexpected success with the single "Smells Like
            Teen Spirit" from their second album Nevermind (1991). This marked
            Nirvana's entry into the mainstream and brought the grunge genre
            with it. Frontman Kurt Cobain was said to be a "voice of a generation"
            by the media.

      <h4>
        Cobain was born in Aberdeen, a town in Washington state, located 120 km southwest of Seattle.
        Following his initial six months of life in the nearby town of Hoquiam, he relocated with his
        parents Donald and Wendy to Aberdeen, where he lived during most of his childhood.
        His joyful childhood concluded at the age of nine when his parents parted ways.
        This took a toll on Cobain and he became a reserved, introverted kid.
      </h4>
      <br>
      <h4>
        During high school, he experienced a rebellious phase: he found rock music and experimented with drugs and was
        responsible for vandalism. Cobain was apprehended multiple times, including for vandalism.
        vehicles and structures. In 1985, he departed from high school without obtaining a diploma.
      </h4>
      <br>
      <h4>
        A bit later in the year Cobain encountered fellow punk rock enthusiast Krist Novoselic. 
        In 1987, the two friends established a band Following multiple unsuccessful ventures, such as the group Fecal Matter. 
        after undergoing several name changes by 1988, became known, as Nirvana.

        In 1989, the group featuring drummer Chad Channing launched their first album, Bleach, under the independent
        label Sub Pop.
        Nevertheless, Cobain felt disappointed with Channing's dedication and approach to playing, and in 1990
        Channing was replaced by Dave Grohl from the band Scream.
      </h4>
      <br>
      <h4>
        In 1991, Cobain encountered vocalist Courtney Love from the band Hole at a concert featuring Butthole Surfers
        and L7 in Los √Ångeles. Later that year, the pair revealed their engagement, and on February 24, 1992, Cobain
        wedded Courtney Love on the shore in Hawaii.
        In 1992, Cobain and Love welcomed their daughter, Frances Bean Cobain. Cobain named his daughter in honor of
        Frances McKee, the frontwoman of The Vaselines. Frances' second name
        indicates that she looked like a bean during the ultrasound, as stated by Cobain.
      </h4>
      <br>
      <h4>
        Love called a meeting on March 25 to force Cobain to check himself into a rehab facility in order to overcome
        his heroin addiction. After five days, Cobain took a plane to Los Angeles to start receiving care at the clinic.
        At Cobain's request, a buddy had purchased a shotgun in Seattle
        earlier that day. Early on the evening of March 31, Cobain scaled the clinic's two-meter-tall wall and ran away.
        Since Cobain was unable to be located, Courtney Love engaged private detective Tom Grant to track him down.
        Cobain was reported missing to the police on April 4.
      </h4>
      <br>
      <h4>
        An electrician working on a security system installation discovered Cobain's body in his Seattle home on April
        8, 1994. He claimed that before he observed a tiny bit of blood surrounding Cobain's head, he seemed to be
        asleep.
        The body was discovered next to a suicide message and a Remington shotgun....
